            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a dedicated full-stack junior web developer based in the northeast region of the Twin Cities, Minnesota. My focus is on creating robust and user-friendly web applications, ensuring optimal performance and functionality. With a solid foundation in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Bootstrap, jQuery, Express.js, as well as well as other various technologies, I have successfully developed and deployed numerous websites. <br><br>I am continuously expanding my skills to stay updated with the latest industry convetions and practices. My passion for coding and web development began immediately when I was introduced to these concepts. Since then, I have immersed myself into learning the field. Below are a couple of projects that I have built from scratch, including a calculator built with mostly JavaScript, and a weather app that utilizes an API. Besides coding, I enjoy riding fast motorcycles on racetracks, disc golf, playing music, and anything coffee related.</p>

                <p>
                    Built this simple calculator when I was learning JavaScript. It can do most everyday calculations that a person would need. I used only JavaScript for the logic and some CSS to make it look decent.
